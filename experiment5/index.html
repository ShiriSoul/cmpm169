				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>
					This experiment has us experiment with 3D graphics such as impossible geometry.<br>
					There were other options but impossible geometry is what I'm going to do for this experiment.<br>
					This experiment focuses on interacting with the drawing by moving the mouse and the patterns changing based on the corresponding mouse position.
					<br>
					This is my final result<br>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>
					<b>Imitate</b><br>
					For this project I took inspiration from the design and code of a generative design we were able to choose from for this assignment.<br>
					The example I chose from was to generate a pattern and have the mouse position affect the pattern.<br>
					I chose to imitate this because the lines changing makes it seem almost 3D-like with walls or something being looked at different angles.<br>

					<br>
					<b>Intergrate</b><br>
					To start this project I first implemented my own version of the example design by having my code generate a pattern of lines which will have them change in width and height based on the mouse position.<br>
					As you can see the implementation turned out just as I wanted.<br>

					<br>
					Next I wanted to improve the project with something unique so I added this way to change the color based on mouse press.<br>

					<br>
					<b>Innovate</b><br>
					I was quite happy with my integration but it definitely was missing something so to make it more interesting I took from my experiment 2 and implemented a dynamic circle.<br>
					In experiment 2 I had used rings that grow and decrease but for this I kept it simple and used a solid circle.<br>
					The circle would change colors like the pattern and grow and decrease based on the mouse's X position.<br>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This experiment was really easy to do as it was similar to the previous experiments but was quite challenging with making a design that looks 3D when it wasn't.<br>
					I'm quite happy with the result as it is both interactive and fulfills the requirements.<br>
					The mouse position changing the pattern and circle really doesn't make this effect that makes the design look almost 3D.<br>
					I can say this project wasn't too difficult once you get started but thinking of an idea to start was the most challenging and after that I was able to achieve everything I wanted.<br>
					I'm quite happy with this experiment.<br>

				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>
					This experiment has us experiment with text and how to adjust and change them to create fun designs.<br>
					This experiment focuses on mouse positions to adjust the text size and position to sort and mess up the lines from the Art of War I used.<br>
					<br>
					This is my final result<br>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>
					<b>Imitate</b><br>
					For this project I took inspiration from the design and code of a generative design we were able to choose from for this assignment.<br>
					The example I chose from was the one below where you can change the word's opacity with the 'A' key and mouse X position will sort the text so from A-Z letters closer to A will be higher and ones closer to Z will be lower.<br>
					<a href="http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/sketches/?01_P/P_3_1_3_01" target="_blank">Design Link</a><br>
					<br>
					<b>Intergrate</b><br>
					To start this project I first implemented my own version of the example design by getting my code to also sort based on mouse X position.<br>
					The 'A' key also does the alpha transparency adjustment.<br>

					<br>
					<b>Innovate</b><br>
					I was quite happy with my integration but now it was time to go further. I added a way to move my text using the mouse Y position too but also change size based on it.<br>
					This was based on <a href="http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/sketches/?01_P/P_3_0_01" target="_blank">this design</a> where the mouse X position could be used to change a letter's size.<br>
					I also adjusted the default color to magenta for something nicer to me and added where the 'R' key would create a color cycle like rgb keyboards.<br>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>
					This experiment was really easy to do.<br>
					I was quite easily able to imitate the design I liked and it was fun messing around to make the design do more than just sort alphabetically by the X position of the mouse.<br>
					I had to incorporate if statements like I would in Unity with, if the mouse held then allowed Y position tracking. This was fun since I haven't really got to do that yet for this project.<br>
					I also had no issue creating the rgb cycle effect which adds that colorful touch. I'm quite happy how this turned out.

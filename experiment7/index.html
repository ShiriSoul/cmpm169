				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>
					This experiment has us experiment with data visualization and apis.<br>
					<br>
					This experiment focuses on taking data from an api and creating a generative design using that data.<br>
					The result of this experiment was a  bubble chart that takes data of the highest fire rate weapons in Valorant from Valorant-API.<br>
					NOTE: some of the weapons have the wrong fire rate on the API as patches for the game over time and alternative fire rates really affect the result.<br>
					<br>
					This is my final result<br>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>
					<b>Imitate</b><br>
					For this project I took inspiration from the website masterychart.com which has the user input a League of Legends account tag and it will output a bubble chart with all their mastery levels for champions in the game.<br>
					I wanted to create something that would take data and put them in a bubble chart like that.<br>
					<img src="assets/masterychart.png" width="500"> <br>
					<br>
					<b>Intergrate</b><br>
					To start this project I first implemented code that would take data from the Valorant-API.<br>
					As I'm not used to API's this was a challenge to implement but once I saw the console output the data on my local host server, I was able to move onto the next step.<br>
					<img src="assets/test0.JPG"> <br>
					<img src="assets/test0a.JPG"><br>
					<br>
					Now I simply implemented a barebones draw function to create circles of different sizes that would represent the data.<br>

					<img src="assets/test1.JPG" width="1500"><br>
					<br>
					<b>Innovate</b><br>
					The project was pretty much done but I took this chance to make the experiment more complete overall by doing little improvements.<br>
					The biggest improvements were a black background for the canvas and I implemented keys to save and regenerate the bubble chart.<br>
					I did try to implement alternative data visuals like a bar graph but I wasn't able to figure that out in the limit time.<br>
					I do believe the integration in itself is innovation as the reference I was imitating was for League of Legends mastery levels while mine used Valorant's gun statistics and it was my first attempt at an API.<br>
					<img src="assets/test2.JPG"> <br>
					<br>
					The result turned out amazing as you can see.<br>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>
					This experiment was really challenging as it was my first real attempt at using API's.<br>
					Even though I had a hard time getting started despite knowing what I wanted to create, once I took reference from an old group project and used typescript, I was able to take that knowledge and apply it to this experiment.<br>
					The old project used yaml and had two typescript files I made with the help of my group mates to create weather scenarios. I took that general knowledge and applied it to Valorant-API.<br>
					Understanding how to receive data from the API was the hardest part, after I got that it was all downhill as I just had to assign the data to their respective circle that would be drawn to create the bubble chart.<br>
					This project taught me a lot and I'm quite proud of the result.

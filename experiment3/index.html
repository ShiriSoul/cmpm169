				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>
					This experiment is similar to experiment 2 with the generative design where we base our code and design off of a free source generative design. This experiment differs in what you are required to make.<br>
					I chose to meet the requirement for replicating a natural process by doing fractal and recursive patterns and growth and decay to simulate tree branches and leaves growing.<br>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>
					<b>Imitate</b><br>
					For this project I took inspiration from the design and code of a generative design we were able to choose from for this assignment.<br>
					<a href="http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/sketches/?01_P/P_2_2_4_01" target="_blank">Design Link</a><br>
					<br>
					<b>Intergrate</b><br>
					To start this project my goal was to create a plant growing. I started this by replicating the branching circle design that I based from the reference design.<br>

					<br>
					I was practically done with just this alone but I needed to really show  that this is a tree so I decided to add leaves that have a chance to grow touching the branches like real leaves.<br>
					This approach was easy as I did the same as the branches with small tweaks to adjust it so it doesn't overtake the branches.<br>
					At this point I was basically done but I went further and adjusted the branch colors to brown to look like branches.<br>

					<br>
					<b>Innovate</b><br>
					I was happy with this project as it was and you can tell there was innovation with the leaves generation as seen under integration.<br>
					To finish this up we were challenged to add audio to our project to enhance the simulation.<br>
					I went through some audio files I found but the best was by far this one I found of branches snapping which could sound like a tree growing really fast.<br>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>
					This experiment was really easy to do as it was similar to experiment 2.  I didn't really have an issue with recreating the branching design. I did have an issue turning it into lines so I scrapped that idea.<br>
					I think this experiment really was fun and interesting as I was able to learn to make a branching circle as well as learning to overlay the green leaves generating design over it which was something I troubleshooted a small bit.<br>
					I'm quite proud of how this turned out as it looks like a sakura branch growing which is quite nice.<br>
					I kept a few other implementation designs that I didn't use in this final take as comments, like as clicking will grow the branch from that point to simulate planting seeds and the original green leaves color.
